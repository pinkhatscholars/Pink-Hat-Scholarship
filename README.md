### 🌸 About Pink Hat Scholars?

---
Pink Hat Scholars is more than a scholarship — it’s a movement to inspire and empower the next generation of cybersecurity professionals.
Recipients of the Pink Hat Scholarship receive a certificate of their choice to help them take their first big step toward a cybersecurity career. Along the way, they gain access to Pink Hat’s YouTube channel, where they can watch practical security awareness videosm not just to qualify for the scholarship, but to learn tips they can use every day to protect themselves and others online.
But Pink Hat Scholars is about more than technical training. Scholars are paired with Pink Hat and provided career coaching, resume reviews, encouraging support, and realworld resources to help them build confidence and succeed in a competitive field.
Pink Hat was created from a personal journey: when its founder was in college, she faced financial struggles, was one of the few women in a male dominated tech program, and even endured bullying for pursuing a career in cybersecurity. Those challenges lit a fire to create something better — a program where future cybersecurity leaders can dream big, have fun, and still be the best at what they do, while driving positive change in cyberspace and fighting back against the hackers who harm people’s lives.
At its heart, Pink Hat Scholars is about community, growth, and transformation helping others break barriers, build resilience, and become the cybersecurity professionals the world needs. Welcome to Pink Hat <3!
